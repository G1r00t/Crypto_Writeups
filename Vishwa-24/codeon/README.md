# CODEON

## Author :  Sankalp Chakre

### DESCRIPTION :
* My biochemist friend has doubt that his phone is used by others for calling without knowing him. So, he wants me to find some information related to it, thatâ€™s why he sent me some information related to it, also he uses one word short-forms mostly. But I am unable to understand sent data, can you help me?

###Files :
* [CODEON.txt](CODEON.txt)

####Analysis : 
* On reading codeon.txt we get that first we have to find how the matrix R is being calculated from P and Q which is a bit guessy here
* I tried many things here like addition,subtration,dot product,multiplication, But particularly on element-wise-multiplication and since the name of Dmitri Mendeleev was given i thought of the periodic table and after element wise multiplication and then taking mod 118 of each element we get the result matrix 
* so using this script 
```python
import numpy as np

matrix_a = np.array([
    [45, 35, 93, 95, 24, 65],
    [25, 15, 55, 64, 36, 45],
    [15, 65, 62, 16, 65, 38],
    [19, 64, 35, 69, 65, 63],
    [47, 67, 48, 60, 39, 27],
    [66, 48, 77, 22, 10, 69]
])

matrix_b = np.array([
    [33, 25, 30, 11, 68, 65],
    [83, 36, 19, 33, 55, 51],
    [20, 16, 48, 63, 41, 71],
    [30, 42, 12, 25, 31, 37],
    [51, 3, 44, 23, 43, 85],  
    [20, 39, 28, 41, 1, 70]   
])

matrix_elementwise_product = matrix_a * matrix_b
matrix_result_mod = np.mod(matrix_result, 118)
print(matrix_result_mod)
```
* I get 
[69,49,76,101,98,95]
[69,68,101,106,92,53]
[64,96,26,64,69.102]
[98,92,66,73,9,89]
[37,83,106,82,25,53]
[22,102,32,76,10,110]
as the result matrix 

* Now converting the numbers in the matrix to there corresponding elements according to the periodic table 

* [Tm  In  Os  Md  Cf  Am]
[Tm  Er  Md  Sg  U  I]
[Gd  Cm  Fe  Gd  Tm  No]
  [Cf  U  Dy  Ta  F  Ac]
 [Rb  Bi  Sg  Pb  Mn  I]
  [Ti  No  Ge  Os  Ne  Ds] 

* And as we can see that the last column comes out to be amino acids.
* On searching the name of Felix Delastelle on google we get that it redirects us to BIFID Cipher so i guessed that aminoacids is the key for decrypting the DATA that is given to us.
* So i go to CyberChef

* And the output was "UGC GCA CUG CUU GAG AGG GGG AUU UUU ACC"
* Now i again got confused about what to do.
* Then i searched the name of challenge Codeon with the term biochemistry and then i got that the result string is CODON which we have to decode to get the final flag
* So i go to dcode.fr

 * And here i got CALLERGIFT as the string 

 * So our flag is VishwaCTF{CALLERGIFT}
